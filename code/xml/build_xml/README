This directory contains all sample code used in the following recipes

* "Build Plain-Vanilla XML Documents"
* "Build Arbitrary XML Documents"

Run them as follows:

$ rake db:migrate
$ ruby script/server

Now point your browser (or curl, or wget) to

http://localhost:3000/customer/show/1

run the Builder example and to

http://localhost:3000/customer/show_flexible/1

to run the "homebrew" solution.

Happy Hacking!
